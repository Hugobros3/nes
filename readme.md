Work-in-progress NES emulator based on [@javidx9](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA) youtube 
series on [making an NES emulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8kx56OZQhg&t=2069s).

Use was made of [his C++ implementation](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES).

Plan: kill two birds with one stone: get moar rust experience, and accomplish a childhood challenge.

## Status

Ep2 of the series complete, can run some very basic 6502 code. Probably will panic when stuff over/underflows in memory.
